Web Scraping for Indeed.com

 I scraped Indeed.com to find out the top 200 Data Scientist job postings in seven cities (LA, Boston, Austin, Chicago, San Francisco, DC and New York) using BeautifulSoup package with Python. 


By examining the basic structure of the URL, I began scraping. Note "q=" indicates the job position or title, "&l=" is for city of interest and "$start=" is the search result where you want to begin.
