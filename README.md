Web Scraping for Indeed.com
Since I am an aspiring data analyst with a strong background in qualitative research in technology management and communication area, I was very curious in what skill sets I need to strengthen before sending off my resume. So I scrape Indeed to find out the top 200 Data Scientist job postings in seven cities (LA, Boston, Austin, Chicago, San Francisco, DC and New York) using BeautifulSoup package with Python. 

 

By examining the basic structure of the URL, I began scraping. Note "q=" indicates the job position or title, "&l=" is for city of interest and "$start=" is the search result where you want to begin.
